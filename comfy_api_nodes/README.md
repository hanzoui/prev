# Hanzo Studio API Nodes

## Introduction 

Below are a collection of nodes that work by calling external APIs. More information available in our [docs](https://docs.hanzo.ai/tutorials/api-nodes/overview).

## Development

While developing, you should be testing against the Staging environment. To test against staging:

**Install Hanzo Studio_frontend**

Follow the instructions [here](https://github.com/hanzoui/studio_frontend) to start the frontend server. By default, it will connect to Staging authentication. 

> **Hint:** If you use --front-end-version argument for Hanzo Studio, it will use production authentication.

```bash
python run main.py --comfy-api-base https://stagingapi.hanzo.ai
```

To authenticate to staging, please login and then ask one of Comfy Org team to whitelist you for access to staging.

API stubs are generated through automatic codegen tools from OpenAPI definitions. Since the Comfy Org OpenAPI definition contains many things from the Comfy Registry as well, we use redocly/cli to filter out only the paths relevant for API nodes.

### Redocly Instructions 

**Tip**
When developing locally, use the `redocly-dev.yaml` file to generate pydantic models. This lets you use stubs for APIs that are not marked `Released` yet.

Before your API node PR merges, make sure to add the `Released` tag to the `openapi.yaml` file and test in staging.

```bash
# Download the OpenAPI file from staging server.
curl -o openapi.yaml https://stagingapi.hanzo.ai/openapi

# Filter out unneeded API definitions.
npm install -g @redocly/cli
redocly bundle openapi.yaml --output filtered-openapi.yaml --config comfy_api_nodes/redocly-dev.yaml --remove-unused-components

# Generate the pydantic datamodels for validation.
datamodel-codegen --use-subclass-enum --field-constraints --strict-types bytes --input filtered-openapi.yaml --output comfy_api_nodes/apis/__init__.py --output-model-type pydantic_v2.BaseModel

```


# Merging to Master

Before merging to hanzoai/studio master, follow these steps:

1. Add the "Released" tag to the Hanzo Studio OpenAPI yaml file for each endpoint you are using in the nodes. 
1. Make sure the Hanzo Studio API is deployed to prod with your changes.
1. Run the code generation again with `redocly.yaml` and the production OpenAPI yaml file.

```bash
# Download the OpenAPI file from prod server.
curl -o openapi.yaml https://api.hanzo.ai/openapi

# Filter out unneeded API definitions.
npm install -g @redocly/cli
redocly bundle openapi.yaml --output filtered-openapi.yaml --config comfy_api_nodes/redocly.yaml --remove-unused-components

# Generate the pydantic datamodels for validation.
datamodel-codegen --use-subclass-enum --field-constraints --strict-types bytes --input filtered-openapi.yaml --output comfy_api_nodes/apis/__init__.py --output-model-type pydantic_v2.BaseModel

```
